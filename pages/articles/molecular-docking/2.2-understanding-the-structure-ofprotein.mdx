<BlogTitle title="Understanding the structure of protein" description="" />


molecular docking revolve aroudn the preocess of identifying teh 3d structure of proteiin
there fore understanding teh structure is essential componenets
with out ists 3d structrure it is diffecult its interection with ligand molecules


Structure of Preotein is compose of 4 Levels

```
Primary secondasrd Tertiary Quaternary
```
## primary structure

primary structure is determind by sequence of amino acid 
MAAGGDHGSP

so several amino acid likn togeter to form this protein structrure ,so this is rearmd as primary structrure of proteiin



## Secondary structure
Alpha Helix , Beta sheet 

this structure can be formed throught to primary structure

arrangement of this structure in 3d strucutres is tearmed as tertiary proteins


## Tertiary structure

so this Alphahelix structure and beta helix structure join togeter and form a tertiary structure

## Quaternary Structure

the proteins are formed of more than one chain consider hemoglobin 
differen chain of proteiin join togeter giving the enteri proterin structure
different subunits are shown in differen colors

&nbsp;

Length of Protein - 480 aa

this form beta shet and alpha helix,and this subunits join togeter and form proutin structrure




molecular docking reloves aroutr identfing the componenets analaysis whic is a difficult stach 

can be achived through teh 3d structure of the protient
