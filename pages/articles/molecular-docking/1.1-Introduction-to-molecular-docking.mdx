# Introduction

**Molecular Docking** is a kind of bioinformatics approach which involves the prediction of a stable complex
of two or more molecules through their Interection

suppose 
 
consider a small protin and ligand we check weathernthe ligand interacts with the protin molecule

[wiki link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein%E2%80%93ligand_complex)

Protein(Receptor) + Ligand  =
deep inside the cavity of the protein(receptor Ligand complex)


this are the biological Interection which happens in cells
this softwarte mimicks the Interection

**biological Interections**

* Protein-ligand Interection
* Protein-protein Interection
* Protein-DNA Interection


In Docking Technique the ligand can be : 
* small molecule
* peptide 
* Protein
* molecule of DNA


components of molecular docking Technique

# what are the Protein

Proteins are made up of amino acids join in the sequence

amino acids are declared through 3 character Gln etc

the amino acid join in sequence and make different protein

20 pairs of amino acid make the protein

length of the protein ranges from fewer amino acid to thousands of amino acids


### Structure of amino acid

three main parts :  amino group, R Group & carboxyl group

the R group gives it's  unique structure

this forms a link and form a protein chain

one amino acid binds and carboxy group of another amino acids this is called as *peptide bond*


this are a form of chemical boinds

protein are long chain of amino acidas joined through the peptide bond
there is release of water molecule in a peptide bond
