<BlogTitle title="Undrestanding the active site of a protein ðŸ’–"/>

by now we have Undrestanding composintin whate are the made up of and stturcurte

one word we will ofter came accros is called binding site ,acive site 

undezstaning is to get maximux effect

so the binding site represent Binding site active site bindigng pocket



binding site = the part of the protein that binds with the small molecule ,i.e the ligand


pockets in tertiary sturece is reffered as binding pockete
it ia are whete it forem a treceptor ligand complex

> Image to add later on

forces involed in are mostly the non-covalendt interction mostly weak forces are involed

>few residues which are actuly bind to the ligand

few resideues of the pocker involved in tnterection


the protein strucurte provides as a framework for the binding site residues to provide their correctm orientaton for their catalysis

the mostly active site are cotained structure with that involved binding with the low molecular weight


so the with out the konwloed of teh reside in the proterin stu  it will to difficult the to predict the bindfing of teh priter

so whenever the protein structure is given the important step will be 
* indefin the poterntail bing site of th porein
* if the protein sture has co crystallize ligan so the site is defind as ligand binding site of the protein
so thimes resecrhe wants to foces on otehr area other than the binding site

whenever the binding site is not available the it thein the competional resource are used to that will hep inpredictin the caity in protein strucurte

## Propertie so fthe binding pockett

* the volume of teh binding pocket should be **greater** than or equal to the volume of the volume of the ligand molecule

this is mostly stated to porply interect with the mol

should occupy the maximu space of the cavity 

is less than cavit then the snall mol wint able to go inside and give teh max interectio

* the shape of the binding pocket should be complementary to the shape of the ligand .teh Ligand should be able to fit inside the pocket

in other words the shape of the binding mol should be such that it is able to go inside and filt only the max interc can vbe achived

*  the physio chemical proopeties of the binding pocket shoiuld be complementary to the ligands


the physichemical properties refets to both the physical and the chemical propter of teh ligand mol

upon tehis propeties teh theraputic activity of teh molecule is depend on

and this **physical  properties** is responsible for teh actioon of teh molecules

chemical peoprter   

    drug reaction
    partion coefficient
    solublit
    protein binding etc


* oterh properties for characterizing  a protein bindign pocket includes teh overall geometry of teh pocket ,the composition of the amino acid residue,teh type of solvation ,the hydrophobicity the electrostatics and teh chemical fragmentrs interections


* the mentioned characteriestics are also important for evaluation of teh pocket's **"druggablity"**
