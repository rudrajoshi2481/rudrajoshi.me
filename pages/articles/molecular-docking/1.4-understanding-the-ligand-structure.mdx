<BlogTitle title="Understanding the structure of ligand 🍔" description="" />

the mole that binds to a macro mol'
the macto molcan be aprotein

can be complex mol of several atoms or single atom

it can be organi or inorganic


when the ligand binds to a poitein it s conformation changes,resuksts in formatio of stable protein ligand complex

use of ligand mol in diffrent types of application

active conformation of a receptor mol is a result of its active site conformation which is generated through the interection of the receptor with the ligand forming stable conformation


presence of the ligand can also make enzyme activate


**protein** 

a protein have a wide varity of teh function

* Structural                    =  cytoskeleton
* Mechanical                    = muscles
* Cell Signaling                =   hormones
* Biochemical                   =   enzyme

the biological function carried ot by the protein through the direct interection of the protein ligand molecules

ligan have very important role in biological function through its interdtion with protein molecules

## Protein Ligand Interection

* the small mol often binds to the protein structure at teh largest pocket on the surface of the protein structure

* Protein ligand interection ocurs within the binding cavity of protein

* Analysis of protein-ligand interections are important for understanding the mechanism of biological regulationn

i fprev slid seen the reside are presein at binding site
example Phe163 , Tyr222 ,Asn216,BL-7273  the *the number represent the number position on the aminio acid in the protein structure*

the amino acid can be seen at active site or the binding site of the protein

* designing of the new drug mol can be carried  out if there is knowledge of the protein ligand binding


## Protein Ligand interections bonds

* Hydrogen Bonds
* Ionci bonds
* Hydrophobic bond
* cation pi nteection


in this type of interection there is no electron sharing in atoms

*active regulation of the protein by the ligand molecules*
