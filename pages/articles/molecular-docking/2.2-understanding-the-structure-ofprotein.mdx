## structure of the protein

&nbsp;

**Molecular docking** revolve around the process of identifying the 3d structure of protein,there for it is essentail to understand the 3d structure of the protein, and it is difficult to understand the interection between the ligand and protein without the 3d structrure



&nbsp;

## Structure of Protein is compose of 4 Levels

```
Primary secondasrd Tertiary Quaternary
```


&nbsp;

Four structure of proteins : 

&nbsp;

* ### primary structure

    * primary structure of amino acid is determind by the sequence of the amino acid
        example of sequnce : MAAGGDHGSP
    * so several amino acid link together and form a protein structure ,so this forms as a *primary structure of the protein*

&nbsp;

* ### Secondary structure

    * Secondary structure forms a Alpha Helix & Beta sheet structure
    * this structrure is form throuhg linking of the primary structure 


&nbsp;



* ### Tertiary structure
    * now the arrangement of the Alpha Helix structure & beta sheet join together and forms a 3d structure which is tearmed as *tertiary protein structure *
    

&nbsp;

* ### Quaternary Structure

    the protein form of more than one chain to form a **Quaternary structure**

the proteins are formed of more than one chain consider hemoglobin 
differen chain of proteiin join togeter giving the enteri proterin structure
different subunits are shown in differen colors

&nbsp;

Length of Protein - 480 aa

this form beta shet and alpha helix,and this subunits join togeter and form proutin structrure




molecular docking reloves aroutr identfing the componenets analaysis whic is a difficult stach 

can be achived through teh 3d structure of the protient
