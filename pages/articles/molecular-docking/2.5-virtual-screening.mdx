visrtual screening technique




method of computer adidied drug discovery 

screenst the large set of compounds

using computional techniques


to get the sctructure that shows the best affinitys


advantages 

    computational testing of compounds insted of physical examinaton wich reduc cost and resources

    redcuce the number of compounds that ar required top be experimmently scrend

    Reduce the timee and cost

    high throughput screening [need to search] & virtaul screening

        it simply means to filter out compound 

        steps 

            chemical library      like AT1 AT2
            durg like properties    lipinski rule vebar rules or egans rule
            ADMET properties profile
                                if those canidate dont show appropriate prop the are removed
        
            Molecular docking
            3d QSAR
            MD stimulations


            finaly we get lead compounds they aree not thre lead compounds not drugs
