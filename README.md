## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rudrajoshi.me.git
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## 📝 Project Structure

- `/src/app` - Main application pages
- `/src/components` - Reusable UI components
- `/public` - Static assets
- `/styles` - Global styles and Tailwind configuration

## 🔧 Development

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
