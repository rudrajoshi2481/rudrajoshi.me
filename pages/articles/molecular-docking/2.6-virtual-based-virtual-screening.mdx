## virtaul based virtual screening


diagram

DAtabase of compouinds => dockied to ceratin taget protein => target of intrest =>  top ranked compoinds

so this screening approach is said structure

many mol and target protein so it is calleed strtucture based screeening



### second


in this method on 
through the base compound it check in the dataase of protein which binds to the specific protein


structrure based 

approach 
    Molecular docking
        database of the compoun are dock to active saite of protein
        we get top ranked componunds

        Second 
            # Inverse docking
                comp of inters is docked agains a panel of diffrnt target
                identify new potential target
            suirtted for thos case whn we dont know the target mol 
                so how to mol bind
