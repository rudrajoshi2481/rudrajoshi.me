1 drug discovery process

CADD
SBDD
vital screening
struc base virtual screening

workfolo of multi stage drug design


what is the actual preocess defin the discovery of the drug mol

drucs which can bee used as medication
which use for some theraputic activity


methods
Hight through put screening method 
    What ? 
        severay assas orbiologca exp are carried to identy drug mol,can be idontified as agonis anta   on ceratin proteins receptores



Process take more than a decade


in anticance drug deveelopment combination aree used fior the better theraputic time whis takes longer duraton of time on animals ,so drug dis is long duration time

*Compound collection* the compounds selected 

Hight througtu screening methd  isolated biological targets 

secondary test bioavablity toxicity metabolics 

is statisfied the goes for clinical Canidate

if not than LEad mol is again charaterized of protein ligand coplex and goes for Design

so this preocess take longer duration of time

clinical canidate are not called drugs bcoz the are canidate and still on experiments 

five step show for drug deicovery
1 Drug discovery
2 Preclinical reserch
3 Clinical developmeent
4 PDA review
5 Post market monitoring




1 Discovery and developemtn

the identifaion of lead comp are caried out so new comp are to be identified so tthis are ideneet from set compoeunds
    assasy deploment clinin
    testing all ADME process and metabilos etc are in this step
    
2 
    cjheks the safety and efficacy of the drugs, so seveeral step like observing the ADMEE properits and toxicty so over all parames are check in this trial so all bio com that show effect adsveerse ffec tand how effectif are this mol compared to the other dtugfs

3 clinical developmeent

    the resecth mode on chte clical developme this is carrie to refine the drug mol to be used in Huimans

4 FDA review

    safeet and effecacy the clical results are approved in cerain condition the FDA might not approve the drug mol
    
5 Post market monitoring
    after the drug approval teh FDA requre the drug monition in public to prevent the adverse efffect and the safeety of the drug 
    FAERS FDA adverse vent reporting systems
