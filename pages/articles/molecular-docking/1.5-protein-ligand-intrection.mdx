<BlogTitle title="Protein Ligand Intrection 🍟"/>

 are all ligands drug moil

 there are lot available has their proerties

 are all the biological mol in the body are drugs ? NO

all ligandsa are biological ligands existing in human body are not drugs


the ligand mol thaht binds to drug targets are called as the drug mol

binding of the drug mol either increase ort decrease the functionality of teh drug mol
there for any molecule to binding of the target is importand to called as the drug mol
or ither decrease or increase

i certain cases it might inhibit the func of the Protein or distrupt the Intrection od drug protein

the neurodegenerative disease or pathogenic decrease the drugs are far more better sol for those problems

> ligand of paracetamol (stillit is represent as the drug mol)

also soluble ligans have become as increasingly importandt class of drugs 
protein are found to be active as recepotor Enzyme Transporter 
so the drugs are molty target to the protein

charact tyhat makle prote good target
are 

* the proptein should have an important role in the regulation of a disease or a health condition
* Modulation of hte protein should not have lethal effect in the people 
* presence of the unique structure

* know 3d structure
* protein should have active ~~



so sumary~~

* Moleular docking requires a protein and a ligand mol
* A protein is made up of amino acids
* Amino acids are linked through a peptide bond
* the biond site are pocket in the protein surface where the ligand binding
* ligand protein intrection are important to regulate the biuoogical function of the protein
* Srugs are the ligand moll that can  alter the fun of the protein

* proetins can be a good target
