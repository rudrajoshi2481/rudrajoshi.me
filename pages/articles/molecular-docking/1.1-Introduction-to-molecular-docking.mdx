## Molecular Docking



**Molecular Docking** is a kind of bioinformatics approach which involves the prediction of a stable complex of two or more molecules through their Interection

&nbsp;

> consider by using a small protein and ligand we check their interection weather the form the [protein Ligand Complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein%E2%80%93ligand_complex)


&nbsp;

```
Protein AKA *receptor*  + Ligand = receptor ligand complex is form deep inside the cavity of the proteins
```

&nbsp;

This are all the *biological interection*  happens in the cell ,in molecular Docking we predict this interection on software through various docking alogorithm


&nbsp;


**biological Interections**

* Protein-ligand Interection
* Protein-protein Interection
* Protein-DNA Interection


&nbsp;


**In Docking Technique the ligand can be :**
* small molecule
* peptide 
* Protein
* molecule of DNA



&nbsp;


**requirment to perform molecular docking**


* Protein Structure information is needed to understand the interection throught 3 diminsional structure and the data can be obtained from the protein databases

* Ligand structure and informaion is also an essential so that can be obtained databases 

* & Docking sofware

## What are proteins ?


proteins are the biomolecules & macromolecules formed by the long chain of amino acid molecule. protein differs from one another primarly in sequence of amino acid .

A linear chain of amino acid residues is called a *polypeptide* . Once a protein exists only fo certain period of time then degrade and recycled through cell machineries through the process of [protin turnover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_turnover)

Abnormal cells are degraded early due to its misfolding and are targeted for desctruction due to being unstable . like other macromolecules like polyscaccharids and nucliec acid ,proteins are also essential part of the body ,they are even found in muscles as *actin* & *myosin* for muscles contractions.

&nbsp;

**Methods commonly use to study the structure of proteins are :**
* [immunohistochemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunohistochemistry)
* [site directed mutagenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site-directed_mutagenesis)
* [x-ray crystallography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_crystallography)
* [nuclear magnetic resonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_magnetic_resonance)
* [& mass spectrometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry)


&nbsp;

proteins are made of the amino acids , the are declared through the first three character eg Gln and their are some amino acids who's name does't starts with the first three characters which are isoleucine,asparagine,glutamine & trypthophan which are abbreviated as Lle,Asn,Gln and Trp

**It is conventional to write nucleotide in lower case & amino acids in upper case**

```
atg : adenine-thymine-guanine
ATG : alanine-threonine-glycine
```

### Structure of amino acid

There are three parts of amino acids namely amino group,R Group,& carboxyl group ,the change in R group gives it's unique structure , this for a strong chain and forms a protein one amino acid binds and carboxy group of another amino acids this is called as *peptide bond* . protein are long chain of amino acidas joined through the peptide bond
there is release of water molecule in a peptide bond


&nbsp;



### list of Amino acids

Their are 20 pairs of amino acids make proteins, length of the protein range from fewer amino acids and thousands of amino acids
